# odin.recipes
This is my first coding project! I have been tasked with
creating a web page for recipes utilizing html. I do not particularly enjoy cooking, so I chose to do cocktail recipes due to my bartending experience.

My goal is to:  
    -Show the ability to create a repository on GitHub  
    -Upload files to GitHub utilizing the Unix terminal  
    -Utilize the aspects of html I have learned to  
    create an organized website  
    -Write a self-reflection at the end on what I learned
